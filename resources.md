There are many skills that we need to informally learn in academia: written and oral communication skills; reproducibility; group dynamics like working on a team, giving/accepting constructive feedback; and getting your own funding... Here I've compiled a list of resources (hopefully up to date) to learn more about some of those skills.

# Reproducibility and best computing practices

# Getting funding

Showing that you can acquire your own funding is very important in the academic landscape. Even if you are fully funded by your department or PI, consider applying for a scholarship or fellowship to learn valuable grant writing skills and improve your CV.
A few examples are below.

# Mental Health Resources on Campus

- The Office of the Dean of Students. This office provides student support, and connects students with appropriate campus resources. The [Dean of Students Office](https://doso.students.wisc.edu/) is the go-to place for student assistance on campus. 608-263-5700; 70 Bascom Hall; Email dean@studentlife.wisc.edu
- [YOU@WISC](go.wisc.edu/gtfidc). This portal has tools, information, and resources to help you be well. YOU@WISC covers a variety of mental health topics including stress management, self-care and social support, anger management, suicidal thoughts, and mindfulness. It also includes physical, personal, and academic wellness topics.
- [SilverCloud](go.wisc.edu/n304zk). Like YOU@WISC, this resource is entirely online. SilverCloud is a self-guided mental health resource that provides treatment options 24 hours a day, no referral from a mental health or medical provider needed. It includes evidence-based learning modules on anxiety, depression, body image, and stress, designed to help students manage day-to-day stresses and improve resilience.
- Interpersonal Process Groups: Interpersonal Process Groups are often the treatment of choice for people who experience troubled relationships, loneliness, depression, anxiety, grief/loss, and low self-esteem. These groups offer a safe environment to identify and explore feelings; to give and receive support and feedback; to practice new, healthier ways of relating to others; and to feel less lonely or isolated. There are also supportive groups for dissertation writing, this supportive group environment is focused on the emotional, behavioral, and organizational challenges associated with the dissertation process. See this [link](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/mental-health/group-counseling/schedule/) for more information.
- [UW-Madison Ombuds services](https://ombuds.wisc.edu/): for research staff
- [University Health Services](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/)
- [Counseling Center](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/mental-health/)
- Medical Services and Mental Health Services (333 East Campus Mall); Lakeshore Drop-In Clinic (Dejope Hall). The no-cost mental health services at UHS include individual, couple/partner, group counseling, campus-based programming, stress management, and psychiatry services. Crisis services are available 24/7.
