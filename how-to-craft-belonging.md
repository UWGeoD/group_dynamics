- We are wired to connect
- Belong is loosely "the feeling that your community respects, values, and cares for you"
- The best predictor of retention for 4 year college students is whether they feel like they belong- AKA_ " I feel like there is a place for me here"
- We are also highly attuned for threats of belonging, like microaggressions
- The response to feeling not welcomed and when someone doesn't feel they belong is PAIN. In fact, the same centers in brain for physical pain are active when there is social pain and non-belonging
- When hiring, people who are looking at job candidates will change the applicant rating criteria to for the applicants to rationalize in their head whether the applicant belongs or not.
- One way to facilitate belonging is by asking people about their values- What do they live for?
- Transition spaces and times (like going into a group meeting, welcoming a new member to the team, starting a new job, etc.) are stressful and are times we feel like we do not belong. The people who are already in the spaces can facilitate belonging by welcoming the new person into their space. Even simple things like hello and introducing yourself help facilitate belonging.
- For leaders and senior folks, telling your mentees that "you belong and it is normal to feel unsure and that you don't belong here. Everyone goes through it" is very powerful and can help in retention. Share stories of when you felt you didn't belong. This is also a key step to see other people who look like you (as they made it through the rough time and so can you).
