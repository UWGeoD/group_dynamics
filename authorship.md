# Authorship guidelines in the GeoD Group

- The trainee (student/postdoc in the group) taking the lead role can expect to be the first author of published work
- Others who help over the course of the project will have the opportunity to earn co-authorship
- We are open to collaborations with equal contributions and first co-authorship
- The first author is responsible for:
    - Writing the [project plan](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/project-plan.md) (often in collaboration with other members of the research team)
    - Leading the project
    - Conducting all analyses
    - Writing the manuscript
    - Revising the manuscript
    - Obtaining approval of all coauthors on the final draft
    - Understanding the general principles of all the work included in the manuscript.
- Jesse will be the senior author (last author) and corresponding author
    - Being last and corresponding author signals that this is a paper from the GeoD Group 
    - The senior author’s responsibility is 
        - to guide the trainee’s analyses, 
        - to provide detailed feedback on all aspects of the work (analyses, presentation of results, writing) and 
        - to conduct careful editing of the draft prepared by the trainee before it can be sent out for publication
- Jesse makes the final decision on authorship and readiness for publication. All authorship is tentative until acceptance.
- Please feel free to bring up questions about authorship with Jesse at any point
- If you leave the group with unpublished work, you should talk to Jesse about plans to finish, submit, and revise. This may include revisiting authorship.
- All abstracts, posters, talks, preprints and papers are representations of the group and must be approved by Jesse before submission.
- All group members should update the "status of all publications" google doc within the GeoD drive throughout the editing, submission, revision, and publication stages.
