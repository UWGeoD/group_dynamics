# Offboarding steps

We are sad to see you go, but excited for the new possibilities in your future!

Steps before you leave the lab:

1. Make sure to document all your work and leave an updated version of any incomplete project in github.
2. Make sure to meet with me a few times to discuss your experience within the group.
3. Make sure to provide your new contact information as I will update the website with how other researchers can reach you in the future.
