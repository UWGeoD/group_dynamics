# Things I wished I knew as an undergraduate student
- Having a good folder and file organization is crucial for peace of mind. Take the time to organize your files so that everything is logical and easy to find (at least to you).
- Take classes on academic writing, science communication, giving talks, and doing poster presentations.
- Become proficient on git/github. Some resources [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md).
- Learn about reproducibility in science. Some resources for reproducibility [here](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/resources.md).

# Things I wished I knew as a graduate student
- Taking good notes of everything you do is incredibly important! All experiments, data analysis, and even short code for sanity checks should be well-explained with readme/textfiles and scripts. It feels like a waste of time at the moment to take notes, but you save much time and energy in the long run when you need to redo things (which will always happen). Re-reading your own code 12 months after it is written is just as hard as reading someone else's code.
- Having a good folder and file organization is crucial for peace of mind. Take the time to organize your files so that everything is logical and easy to find (at least to you).
- Rejection is inevitable in academia and it is rarely a reflection of you. Do your best, but don't feel discouraged when your work is not appreciated by others. Use the opportunity to learn better ways to get your point across and connect with your audience (reviewers).
- Good science communication skills are just as important as the science itself. Some resources on science communication [here](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/resources.md).
- Do not compare yourself to others! We all have our own strengths and weaknesses. Just focus on you!

This is obviously an incomplete list.
