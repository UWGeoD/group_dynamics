# Postdoc guidelines in the Geod Group

### What to expect when you join the group:
- We will have a conversation early on about your future career plans to devise a strategy together.
- Jesse will be fully committed to your growth and success as a scientist and to help you reach your career goals.
- Jesse will provide you with constant opportunities to grow on important academic skills:
    - academic writing
    - science communication skills
    - peer-reviewing for journals
    - good experimental, numerical, and computing practices
    - mentoring skills
    - conference presentations
    - grant writing skills
- Jesse will fully support your quest to find your own fellowships or funding
- Aside from your academic success, your emotional and physical well-being will always be a priority in the group

### What is expected of you:
- You will read and follow the group guidelines: see [here](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/group-guidelines.md)
- You will write the project plan (see format [here](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/project-plan.md)) for the project that we agree to work on together (described in a separate document) within ___ weeks of your arrival to the lab.
    - The project plan should be the first item to agree on as it will guide the whole project.
    - We can discuss and revise this document together before the final version we agree on--but we can also expect this plan to evolve as the research necessitates.
- You will have the intellectual freedom to propose how the project(s) should be tackled and your strategy will be reflected in the project plan that we will both agree on.
- You will be the leading force of the project(s) that we agree to work on together (described in a separate document).
    - You are expected to be first author in the paper(s) and Jesse will be last/corresponding author (see authorship guidelines).
    - You will have the opportunity to mentor graduate or undergraduate students to work with you on this project.

### Other rules:
- The GeoD Group deeply values good science communication: writing, quality of figures and paper presentation needs to be approved by Jesse to make sure that they satisfy the requirements of good science communication.
- The GeoD Group deeply values open-source software and data so methodological papers should be accompanied by open-source software hosted on Github and whenever possible, published as software that others can use. Depending on data type and size, datasets will be hosted in various formats (e.g., Github, Zenodo).
- All abstracts, posters, talks, conference papers, and articles that you work on in the group are representations of the group and must be approved by Jesse before submission.
