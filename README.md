 Useful documents on guidelines, advice, resources for the group.


The Geomechanics and Damage Group (GeoD) is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community that is welcoming, safe, and secure for all students, staff, and faculty from within the group as well as within the community at UW-Madison. As is true for the entire University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) campus, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), and the Geological Engineering program (GLE), GeoD is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access, and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and the University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.

In order to promote a positive relationship between students, staff, and their research advisor (Jesse Hampton), the docs within this repository offer a set of broad guidelines that apply to the mentor-mentee relationship. The goal is that this repository will be used:
- To describe community standards for the mentor-mentee relationship in GeoD
- As part of the orientation for new graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and academic staff
- As a starting point for discussions between group members and their research advisor about the issues addressed herein
- As part of a regular and ongoing discussion between students and research advisors

Mentors and mentees are expected to review and discuss this repository when they begin working together. This repository also reviews the research overview, work-life balance, publishing and travel, and degree progression, among other things. 

Also, this repository is meant to be read/reviewed regularly and comments/suggestions are encouraged to be added and discussed within regular research meetings.
