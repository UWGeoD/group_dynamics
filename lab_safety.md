As a group with substantial laboratory research, health and safety is the highest priority. Please discuss with me and familiarize yourself with the specific health and safety requirements for your project. For people doing experiments please plan to take the following courses as soon as convenient:
- [Personal Protective Equipment Training](https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/33HHHJ/)
- [Chemical Safety Training](https://ehs.wisc.edu/chemical-safety-training/)
- [Compressed Gas Cylinders Training](https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/46RE8L)
- [Disposing Hazardous Chemicals Training](https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/DXH9JC)

In addition to training and following university health and safety rules, laboratory hygiene is an essential aspect of lab safety. Here is a list of general rules and guidelines for minimizing hazards or contamination in the lab. 
- Always wash your hands before and after you eat. Never consume and/or store food or beverages or apply cosmetics in areas where hazardous chemicals or bacteria are used or stored.
- Wear gloves and other personal protective equipment for the appropriate experiments. Laboratory safety glasses or goggles should be worn in any area where chemicals are used or stored. They should also be worn anytime there is a chance of splashes, particulates, or compressed gases and liquids. No contact lenses should be worn around hazardous chemicals – even when wearing safety glasses. Closed-toe shoes should be worn in the laboratory. Laboratory coats should not be stored in offices or break rooms as this spreads contaminates (such as trace radioactive material) to other areas.
- Be aware of clothing, hair, jewelry, etc that has the potential to get caught on equipment or tubing or dangle into chemicals. Take steps to minimize hazards such as keeping any jewelry covered or protected.  
- Know the locations of laboratory safety showers, eye-wash stations, and fire extinguishers. The safety equipment may be located in the hallway near the laboratory entrance. Know emergency exit routes.

Clean up any supplies, unused consumables, waste, or chemicals that you are using before leaving the lab for an extended period of time (i.e. more than a few hours). If you are unsure where or how to store items don’t hesitate to ask. If you have a designated work area for an ongoing experiment then please label that area with your name and cell phone number in case you need to be reached in an emergency (e.g. spills, power outages, etc).
