## Are you an undergraduate student currently enrolled at UW-Madison looking for research experience? <a name="undergrad"></a>

I receive many applications for research positions in my group and can only accept students who are serious about the effort involved and where there is a good fit with my group. 

First of all, please read the rules regarding undergraduate research in the group:
- All research led by undergraduate students is expected to produce either a publication, software, or a particular experimental/field dataset. For this reason, only highly motivated students looking for long-term research opportunities (at least one year in the group) are welcome. 
    - Short-term projects are sometimes available in the group. If you are interested in one-semester or one-summer work, feel free to email me to let me know about this interest, but there is no guarantee that there will be a project that will accommodate this timeline. These positions are possible depending on student background/experience and if the research plan is targeted (e.g., a single experiment). 
- Knowledge of version control via git/github is a significant plus as well as interest in good computing practices, teamwork and science communication.
- Teamwork is highly valued in the group, so you are expected to fully participate in group meetings.

Advantages of joining the group:
- Participate in state-of-the-art research as the leader of a project.
- Gain research experience that is valuable for graduate school and industry jobs.
- Plenty of opportunities to improve science communication (talks, posters, papers).
- Co-authorship on publications produced in the group with your contribution (read the [authorship guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/authorship.md))
- Network with other students in the group and in Engineering, Geoscience, and Computer Science.
- Strong commitment to mentoring by me and other senior students in the group.
- Support with grad school/job applications as well as carefully written honest letters of recommendation highlighting your strengths in research.

### After reading this document, I am still interested in joining the group!

Great! Follow the next steps: Email me your CV and transcript with the subject "Undergrad Research". Write down in the email that you have read this document. Include in the email meeting times that would work for you for the following two weeks. After you send the email, we will schedule a meeting to chat. Expect to answer questions about yourself (major, year, research interests, future plans). It will not be an exam, but I will be curious to know your experience. During this meeting, I will also highlight existing projects in the group to assess if they would be interesting to you.

## Do you want to apply to graduate school at UW-Madison in my group? <a name="apply"></a>

Research is highly multi-disciplinary! So, I welcome graduate students interested in different programs:

- **PhD in Civil Engineering: Fall Application deadline December 15** (email me regarding Spring admission). Application info [here](https://engineering.wisc.edu/programs/degrees/civil-and-environmental-engineering-phd/).
- **PhD in Geological Engineering: Fall Application deadline December 15** (email me regarding Spring admission). Application info [here](https://engineering.wisc.edu/programs/degrees/geological-engineering-phd/)

Next steps for you:
- Read more about the [group research](https://geod.wisc.edu/research/) and identify projects that interest you. This site is updated on a somewhat regular basis.
- Read the [group guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/group-guidelines.md)
- Feel free to email me if you are interested in working with me and have questions regarding the application.
    - Make sure to include your CV and unofficial transcript in the email as well as details on what specific projects or recent articles attract you from the group.
    - If you have read the group guidelines, make sure to comment on this too in your email.

## Are you a graduate student currently enrolled at UW-Madison interested in joining the group (or doing a rotation)? <a name="grad"></a>

- Master/PhD students are welcome to join the group
- I can serve as PhD advisor of students in the following programs:
    - Civil Engineering
    - Geological Engineering
    - Geoscience
- Research in the group is highly interdisciplinary, so students from different fields are welcome as all projects can be tailored to damage mechanics, remote sensing, induced seismicity, geothermal energy, machine learning, or structural health monitoring
- Advantages of joining the group:
    - Participate in state-of-the-art research as the leader of a project.
    - Gain research experience that is valuable for postdoc positions, faculty roles, and industry jobs.
    - Plenty of opportunities to improve science communication (talks, posters, papers).
    - Co-authorship on publications produced in the group with your contribution (read the [authorship guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/authorship.md))
    - Network with other students in the group.
    - Strong commitment to mentoring by me and other senior students in the group.
    - Support with grad school/job applications as well as carefully written honest letters of recommendation highlighting your strengths in research.

Next steps:
- Send me an email with your CV and unofficial transcript as well as your interest in working with me and what type of projects interests you most. Include in the email meeting times that would work for you for the following two weeks.
- After you send the email, we will schedule a meeting to chat. Expect to answer questions about yourself (undergrad degree, research experience, research interests). During this meeting, I will also highlight existing projects in the group to assess if they would be interesting to you.

## Do you want to apply for a postdoc position in the group? <a name="applypostdoc"></a>

I am interested in collaborating with postdocs with any research background.

Postdocs in the group are expected to lead projects and grow as fully independent researchers, so in order to start a conversation, you need to:
- Read the [group guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/group-guidelines.md)
- Read the [authorship guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/authorship.md)
- Read the [postdoc guidelines](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/postdoc-guidelines.md)
- Be familiar with [research in the lab](https://geod.wisc.edu/research/) and read several recent papers produced by the group.
- Identify a project (or several projects) that you would like to work on and start pitching ideas in a rustic [project plan](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/project-plan.md) (goal, background, objectives). I am happy to fall outside of the group's comfort zone if you have a good project plan! In fact, some of the most exciting projects we have ongoing are new topics and ideas that even I have no experience with.

Send me an email (subject "Postdoc application") with:
- CV
- two names of recommenders
- short paragraph describing your current research
- links or PDFs of X publications you have co-authored, and explain the role you had in each publication (0 < X < 3)
- a pitch of a potential project plan (goal, background, objectives) that we could work on together
- meeting times for the following two weeks

## Do you have your own independent research ideas as a postdoc and you want to apply to your own funding with me as a supervisor? <a name="postdocfunds"></a>

First of all, great idea to pursue your own sources of funding! This not only gives you the flexibility to work on the project you love, but it also builds a stronger CV with evidence of external funding.

I am happy to serve as your postdoc supervisor on any postdoc fellowship/awards/grants and even help you with the application. To find some options for postdoc funding (some do not require citizenship), see [here](https://github.com/UWGeoD/group_info/blob/hamptonjesse-patch-1/resources.md).

Send me an email (subject "Postdoc application with own funding") with:
- CV
- short paragraph describing your current research
- information on the fellowship/award/grant you want to submit as well as the deadline
- the pitch of the project proposal you will submit (goal, background, objectives)
- what do you need from me? Letter of support, feedback on the project proposal,...
- meeting times for the following two weeks
